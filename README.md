# MotorQ

Mini Challenge 1 Team 3

## Application Description & Problem Statement :

How to empower motorcycle driver & owner in Cohort 7 to regularly maintain their motorcycle to avoid financial loss?

based on that challenge we created a solution app named MotorQ to remind owners or riders to manage their own motorbike through a friendly reminder and a list of recommended components to be checked up regularly in order to avoid the potential financial risk.
